*** Gouty Toe Reggae
(Verse 1)
Woke up dis mornin', sun in di sky
But a wicked pain mek mi wanna cry
Mi foot a-throbbin', big like a yam
Dis gouty toe, ah di debil, man!

(Chorus)
Mi gouty toe, mi gouty toe,
Don't you know, Miguelito, has got to go!
It got mi limpin', got mi down low
Dis is di worst pain mi ever know!

(Verse 2)
Mi wife she seh, "You stubborn, yuh hear?
Dat salt fish an' rum, you mus' mek it clear
Fi di sake a' yuh health, an' fi di good a' we life
Give up dem ting deh, an' ease dis strife."

(Chorus)
Mi gouty toe, mi gouty toe,
Don't you know, Miguelito, has got to go!
It got mi limpin', got mi down low
Dis is di worst pain mi ever know!

(Bridge)
Tryin' all di remedies, all di bush tea
But dis gout it stickin' tight to mi
Di doctor seh, "Change up yuh ways, youth!
Fi get rid a' dat pain, dat's di honest truth."

(Verse 3)
Mi wife she says, "Won't go away
Until I give up those Pepsi every day!"
A little sacrifice, fi live long an' strong
Fi send dis gouty toe right back where it belong.

(Chorus)
Mi gouty toe, mi gouty toe,
Don't you know, Miguelito, has got to go!
It got mi limpin', got mi down low
Dis is di worst pain mi ever know!

(Outro)
Yeah, mi gouty toe!
Got to let it go!
One love, one life, an' no more pain, dread!
Woah!
